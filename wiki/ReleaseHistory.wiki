#MetCor release history (back-end + GUI package releases)

This page is an archive of informal release notes for every Jar-file of the back-end and GUI that has been released, starting from Rev. 15.

*[http://code.google.com/p/metcor/downloads/detail?name=MetCor_r21v1.zip Rev. 21, Version 1.0] - DEPRECATED FOR QTBA analysis*
 * semantic change in redistributed concentrations method for averaging CWT specifically, which uses a weighted average formula instead of a simple averaging formula(see SVN-diff for more details):
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CWT_{\rm AVG}(m) = \frac{1}{\sum_{\forall i,j}{N_{ijm}}}\sum_{\forall i,j}N_{ijm}CWT(i,j)_{m}%.png"/>
 * download [http://code.google.com/p/metcor/downloads/detail?name=MetCor_r18v1.zip Rev. 18, Version 1.0] for the previous version, which uses:
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CWT_{\rm AVG}(x) = \frac{1}{N_{grids}}\sum_{\forall i,j}CWT(i,j)_{x}%.png"/>

where x,m are endpoint identifiers (i.e. back trajectory originating dates/"source IDs"). *all future versions will use the revised CWT averaging scheme unless explicitly specified*

*[http://code.google.com/p/metcor/downloads/detail?name=MetCor_r18v1.zip Rev. 18, Version 1.0]*
 * minor semantic change in redistributed concentrations method; the wrong method of redistributing concentrations was made before (see SVN-diff for more details).
 * *previous revisions should be considered deprecated for ALL RTWC methods*

*[http://code.google.com/p/metcor/downloads/detail?name=MetCor_r18v1.zip Rev. 18, Version 1.0]*
 * minor semantic RTWC fix: {{{World.percentDiff(...)}}} has been changed to the correct definition of percent convergence. Previous builds added before Revision 16 should not be used for RTWC calculations where convergence criteria are specified.

*[http://code.google.com/p/metcor/downloads/detail?name=MetCor_r15v1.zip Rev. 15, Version 1.0] - deprecated for RTWC-convergence criteria calculations*
 * matrices for RTWC-based calculations with convergence criteria are printed out during the calculation period if they have at least met the user-defined convergence criteria. For debugging purposes, they are also redundantly printed out at the end
 * minor technical RTWC fix - previous revisions should not be used for RTWC-calculations with convergence criteria
