#MetCor release history (back-end + GUI package releases)

This page is an archive of informal release notes for every Jar-file of the back-end and GUI that has been released, starting from Rev. 15.

*[http://code.google.com/p/metcor/downloads/detail?name=MetCor_r15v1.zip Rev. 15, Version 1.0] - deprecated for RTWC-convergence criteria calculations*
 * matrices for RTWC-based calculations with convergence criteria are printed out during the calculation period if they have at least met the user-defined convergence criteria. For debugging purposes, they are also redundantly printed out at the end
 * minor technical RTWC fix - previous revisions should not be used for RTWC-calculations with convergence criteria
