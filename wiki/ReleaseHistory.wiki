 * minor semantic RTWC fix: {{{World.percentDiff(...)}}} has been changed to the correct definition of percent convergence. Previous builds added before Revision 16 should not be used for RTWC calculations where convergence criteria are specified.

 * matrices for RTWC-based calculations with convergence criteria are printed out during the calculation period if they have at least met the user-defined convergence criteria. For debugging purposes, they are also redundantly printed out at the end
 * minor technical RTWC fix - previous revisions should not be used for RTWC-calculations with convergence criteria
